# **Travel Analysis**

### Project Overview

This project looked into providing insights on customers travel preferences in order to provide tailored and efficient services as a travel agency. By analyzing various aspects of the data, I seek to provide insight amongst many others on the most preferred destination, month of travel and preferred transportation.

### Data Acquisition and Cleaning

The data was acquired using a Google form that aimed to understand customers preferences on their travel needs. The form was connected to Google Sheet to view the data. The data was then exported as a csv file and loaded into Excel.
I renamed the headers to aid readability and carried out EDA to check for errors, missing values, and black cells. I also ensured each column had the appropriate data type.
The dataset initially contained 334 records excluding the header but was brought down to 332 records due to the missing values in cells F78 and F211, which I didnâ€™t want to infer so as to maintain the integrity of the data.
